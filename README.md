# Cryptography and Network Security Exam

## Question 2: Encryption and Integrity Application

This project contains a Python security application for protecting a sample student record file.

### Requirements

The application performs the following functions:

1. Encrypts a supplied student record file.
2. Saves the encrypted output.
3. Decrypts the encrypted file.
4. Verifies that the decrypted contents match the original file.
5. Calculates a SHA-256 hash of the student record file.
6. Detects whether the student record file has subsequently changed.
7. Handles missing files and invalid inputs without crashing.

## Installation

### 1. Install Python

Python 3 is required to run the application.

### 2. Install the Cryptography Library

Open Command Prompt and run:

```text
python -m pip install cryptography
```

## Project Structure

    ├── encryption_tool.py
    ├── student_records.txt
    ├── student_records.txt.encrypted
    ├── student_records.txt.decrypted
    └── student_records.txt.sha256
```

## Execution Instructions

1. Open Command Prompt.
2. Navigate to the `encryption_tool` folder.
3. Run the following command:

```text
python encryption_tool.py student_records.txt
```

The program will encrypt the student record, decrypt it, verify the decrypted contents, calculate the SHA-256 hash, and perform an integrity check.

## Integrity Testing

On the first execution, the application stores the original SHA-256 hash.

If the student record file is modified afterwards, run the program again. The application compares the current SHA-256 hash with the stored original hash and reports whether the file has changed.

For example:

```text
Integrity check: PASSED - File has not changed.
```

If the file has been modified:

```text
Integrity check: FAILED - File has been changed.
```

## Error Handling

The application handles common errors such as:

* Missing student record files
* Missing or invalid encryption keys
* Invalid encrypted files
* Invalid command-line input
* Permission errors

The program displays an error message instead of crashing.

## Encryption Key Security

The encryption key is stored **outside the GitHub repository**.

The key is not uploaded or committed to GitHub.
